# Life on Europa: A Deep Dive into Potential Habitability

## Introduction to Europa's Ocean
Europa, one of Jupiter's largest moons, is a prime candidate in the search for extraterrestrial life due to strong evidence of a vast subsurface ocean beneath its icy crust. This ocean is believed to be in direct contact with a rocky core, allowing for potential hydrothermal activity.

## Energy Sources for Europan Life
Life requires energy. On Earth, sunlight is the primary energy source, but deep-sea ecosystems thrive on chemosynthesis. For Europa, potential energy sources include chemical reactions from hydrothermal vents and radiolytic products from the interaction of Jupiter's radiation with water ice.

## Potential Biosignatures
Identifying life on Europa would involve searching for biosignatures. These could include complex organic molecules, unusual isotopic ratios, or evidence of metabolic byproducts in plumes or cryovolcanic eruptions.
